The Gesture Recogniotion project relies on recogniotion gestures by neural network. Project using internet camera to find a hand and check which gesture is showing. Project was written full in Python tehnology. Project consists of:

a) Data folder - in this folder are folders with pictures of gestures or signs that our neural network will learn. (This folder is on my pc because is quite a big, close to 1000 photos of one gesture)
b) dataCollection.py - this script is used to collect photos of our gestures with webcam.
c) test.py - this script is main of project. We declare there which model of neural network we want to use and with webcam this program recognize our gestures.
